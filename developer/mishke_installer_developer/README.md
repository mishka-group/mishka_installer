# MishkeInstallerDeveloper

### Welcome to Mishka Installer Developer!
With this sample, you can create a project without basic dependencies, we implemented Mishka Installer as a directory of codes, and you do not need to add it as a dependency when you want to develop something
After making a library, you should roll out your plugin as standard elixir hex pkg or an acceptable format. 
This project just helps you to create your own plugin without waiting to compile whole the project.
